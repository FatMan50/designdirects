[Strasser](http://strasserwood.com/) has expanded its bath vanity collections with Dusky Oak, a rustic, yet sophisticated finish. Dusky Oak presents the same rustic look and feel as reclaimed wood—a building material that is trending throughout residential, hospitality, and commercial interiors. <!--more-->A soulful finish with a time-worn look, [Dusky Oak makes a statement](http://strasserwood.com/) with any style of décor, from sleek and modern to classically traditional. Similar to the ageless beauty of reclaimed wood from old barns, factories, and warehouses, Dusky Oak injects a rich sense of character into the bath. It is unique in that its rustic textures seem to echo the past, but the clean lines and modern shapes align with today’s transitional and modern décor styles. Blending beautifully with light, muted colors, the versatile [Dusky Oak finish](http://strasserwood.com/) pairs well with Polished Chrome, Polished Nickel, and Oiled Bronze hardware finishes—which also help to give a modern update to the rustic look.
