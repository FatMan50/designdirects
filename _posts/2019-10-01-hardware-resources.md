The STORAGE with STYLE™ designer organizer collection from [Hardware Resources](https://www.hardwareresources.com) comprises a Pot & Lid Organizer pullout, a [Base Cabinet Pullout](https://www.hardwareresources.com/organizers/cabinet-organizers.html), Double or Single Trash Can Pullout, and a Pullout Basket and Pilaster System.<!--more-->
STORAGE with STYLE cabinet organizers feature clean, sleek curved flat wire design details that flow across each organizer to create a cohesive collection identity. Each organizer comes in a choice of two on-trend finishes—Polished Chrome and Black Nickel—allowing designers and consumers to match with other design elements or add contrast for variation. The finishes are plated, rather than powder-coated, for added durability.
