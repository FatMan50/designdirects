[Feeney, Inc.](http://www.feeneyinc.com/ "Awning Kits") introduces a line of stationary awnings designed to provide protection in a wide variety of climates and settings. Constructed of powder-coated aluminum and strong polycarbonate panels for long-lasting durability and defense from the weather, the [new Awning Kits](http://www.feeneyinc.com/ "Awning Kits") are available in two styles: Icon, a streamlined design with clean lines and curves, and Era, a classical design with a more ornate look and feel. A modular approach simplifies installation and enables selection of components based on project and design preferences. Customers simply choose a style, and then select the desired polycarbonate panel option, frame color, and any extension kits.

The [Awning Kits](http://www.feeneyinc.com/ "Awning Kits") are suitable for a broad range of climates and have been engineered to withstand snow/wind loads up to **35.5** psf. Built-in rain gutters at the front edge of the awnings direct runoff to the sides. The polycarbonate panels come in a choice of clear, frosted and gray tint, and awning frames are available in 14 standard colors, including [Feeneyâ€™s](http://www.feeneyinc.com/ "Awning Kits") vibrant Express Yourself hues, along with custom colors. Optional extension kits can be added to extend awning coverage on straight sections and around corners.
