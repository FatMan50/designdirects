Samsung’s [redesigned top-load Washing Machine](https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/washers/) is now available in an elegant Champagne finish. Champagne finish blends perfectly with a variety of color palates and textures, like natural woods, thick grained marble, and tile patterns that complement today’s design trends.  The Champagne finish will be available in [Washing Machine](https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/washers/) model, **WA54R7600**, along with the matching electric and gas dryers, **DVE54R7600** and **DVG54R7600**. <!--more-->

In addition to the beautiful Champagne finish, the **WA54R7600** Top Load Washer features Super Speed, a setting that will wash a full load of laundry in **36** minutes without sacrificing any cleaning performance. This Top Load Washer has an Extra Large capacity tub that is large enough to fit a king size comforter and more. It also features Steam washing, which helps remove tough stains while still being gentle on clothes, and Active Waterjet, a water faucet built right into the washer that allows users to pre-treat soiled clothes. 

[Samsung’s new matching dryers](https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/washers/) in Champagne are equally powerful, including a Steam Sanitize+ cycle that eliminates allergens and steams away wrinkles, odors, and static and Sensor Dry, which optimizes cycle time and temperature to protect clothes from heat damage and reduce energy usage.
