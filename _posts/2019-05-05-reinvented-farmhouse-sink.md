A contemporary take on a classic style, the [BLANCO IKON®](https://www.blanco-germany.com/int/en/home/) is the first [farmhouse sink(https://www.blanco-germany.com/int/en/home/)] of its kind – crafted from BLANCO’s patented SILGRANIT® material which is ultra-cleanable, colorful, and extremely durable. BLANCO has been the leader in granite sinks for more than three decades, and the IKON family continues the tradition of excellence in three sizes: 33”, 30”, and the new 27” size designed for smaller spaces.

The sink is one of the most heavily used areas in the kitchen - and apron front sinks experience more contact than traditional undermount sinks. The science behind our [SILGRANIT](https://www.blanco-germany.com/int/en/home/) material offers a level of protection that ensures that the apron front on the IKON won't scratch and will maintain its beauty after years of use. From rinsing fresh vegetables to washing the dishes, the IKON breathes new life into the cycle of preparing family meals. Beautifully designed. Scientifically proven.
