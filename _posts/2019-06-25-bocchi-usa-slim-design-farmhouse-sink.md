[Bocchi USA](http://www.bocchiusa.com/) has recently unveiled their slim-design Farmhouse Sink, the Forte. Forte, which features a slim profile and complex blend of natural materials that allows its wall thickness to be cut nearly in half versus traditional fireclay sinks. <!--more-->As a result, the interior basin size functionally increases to offer homeowners more room to maneuver pots and pans. How much more room? Forte provides roughly **15%** to **20%** more cubic volume than the average apron-front sink.

On top of that, the new Forte sink hits another **2019** kitchen design mark. Blending organic materials with aluminum, the Forte sink maintains the warmth and elegance of fireclay while adding the strength of metal. This increased strength allows for thinner walls that bring an updated look to the classic farmhouse sink everyone is craving this year. Forte is available in all nine of [Bocchi’s designer colors](http://www.bocchiusa.com/), including white, black and gray in both matte and glossy finishes as well as sapphire blue, biscuit and brown.
