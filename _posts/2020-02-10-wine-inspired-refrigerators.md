The [Vin Nouveau Collection from Elmira Stove Works](https://www.elmirastoveworks.com/) features **four** sophisticated new colors, each corresponding to a popular wine varietal. Chenin Blanc is a soft pale beige, reminiscent of apple and pear orchards in fragrant bloom. Rosé is an unassuming blush hue that evokes thoughts of rose petals and sun-kissed French terraces.<!--more--> Pinot Noir is a warmly saturated red with undertones of cherry and exotic spices for an Old World feel while Syrah is a deep, elegant burgundy that conjures up the scent of tobacco and a sense of drama and mystery. In addition to the Vin Nouveau collection, [Elmira Stove Works](https://www.elmirastoveworks.com/) offers its Northstar line in nine “not so standard” colors along with more than 1,200 custom hues.
