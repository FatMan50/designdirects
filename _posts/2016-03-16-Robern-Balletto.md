[The Balletto vanity](https://www.robern.com/) conveys a sense of style that is both transitional and contemporary.  You will find a balance of comfort, functionality and elegance in a timeless, minimalist design. Hidden storage options house hand towels, waste, magazines and small items to provide a level of convenience while minimizing space.<!--more--> The Balletto vanity captures the legs and pointe work of a ballerina and translates that grace and precision into the vanity. The long slender needle-like point of the legs are reminiscent of a stiletto, demonstrating balance, symmetry and sophistication. Discover the perfect fit with hidden side storage solutions. Your vanity comes with an empty side storage and works well for storing large items. To further personalize your storage, you can easily install additional side storage options. From magazines to tissues, bathroom design does not get more luxe than this.
