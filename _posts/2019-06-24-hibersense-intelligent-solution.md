There are roughly **70-million homes** in the US that have a single-thermostat forced-air **HVAC** system. In such an environment, it is nearly impossible to achieve a balanced level of comfort in every room. [HiberSense is an intelligent solution that delivers improved quality of life](https://hibersense.com/) as well as improved energy efficiency and critical energy usage data.<!--more--> [HiberSense](https://hibersense.com/) represents a tremendous opportunity for HVAC contractors and technology integrators as the only scalable whole-house climate solution that gathers data from every room for intelligent climate management. The [HiberSense smart hub](https://hibersense.com/), sensors and automated vents ensure room-to-room comfort for nearly any environment. The sensor reports temperature, barometric pressure, humidity, light and motion data from each room to the hub, making this the smartest climate solution by far.
