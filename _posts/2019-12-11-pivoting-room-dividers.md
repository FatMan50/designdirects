[Portapivot's pivoting room dividers](https://www.portapivot.com/) and fixed glass partitioning systems are designed to create timeless, visual masterpieces that integrate seamless in any interior style. The traditionally handcrafted crittall door is fully remastered by [Portapivot](https://www.portapivot.com/) with the use of lightweight anodized aluminium and state of the art invisible hardware. <!--more-->Portapivot 6530 (pivot door system) is made from a combination of modern materials such as anodized aluminium and 6 or 8 mm of tempered safety glass. The optional decorative grids are placed on top of the glass and are available in both 15 and 30 mm to create any imaginable grid design. Most people prefer transparent glass, but you can just as well use structured, matte (frosted) or colored glass for various design approaches. [Portapivot’s pivoting doors](https://www.portapivot.com/) are equipped with invisible Stealth Pivot hinges, which feature a self-closing mechanism, that works in all swing directions up to 360°. These innovative pivot hinges make it possible to create pivot doors up to 150 kg, that feel as light as a feather. The frame is available in 4 anodized colors. Black, bronze, silver and a stainless-steel finish. If you desire to create something a little bit different, we've got you covered!
