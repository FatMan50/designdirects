[NanaWall Systems](https://www.nanawall.com "Retractable Screening"), the pioneer of the opening glass wall category, announces its largest screen option available for its sliding glass wall systems: [Screen ONE XL](https://www.nanawall.com "Retractable Screening"). It is a minimally framed, fully retractable and non-pleated screening option with a patented braking system designed for large openings to provide an enhanced indoor/outdoor experience for homeowners. Screen ONE XL features a patented, ultra-strong UV resistant fiberglass mesh that is reinforced with a wire tension system. This system provides a transparent-yet-tough barrier between homeowners and outdoor irritants, while still facilitating fresh air and other innumerable benefits of the outdoor experience. With the use of double installation [Screen ONE XL](https://www.nanawall.com "Retractable Screening") is also Open Corners Possible, which allows screens to meet in the corner and enables open-air patios and porches to provide a year-round option for outdoor entertaining. The screen easily slides in place when needed and stacks away when not in use.
