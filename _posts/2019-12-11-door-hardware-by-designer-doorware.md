[Designer Doorware’s Bullet & Stone collection](https://www.designerdoorware.com/) of door hardware celebrates two timeless classics—concrete and metal. Merging the rough and cold aesthetic of reinforced concrete with sumptuous and eye-catching metals, the result is a visual and tactile experience that allows users to observe both finishes simultaneously, amplifying and bringing to light the contrast between the two materials.<!--more--> Handcrafted with an artisanal concrete mixture specially formulated for durability, texture, and sustainability, the striking, elegant collection is suited for both historic and modern aesthetics. The [Bullet & Stone collection](https://www.designerdoorware.com/) features sculptural pieces, which allow designers and consumers to explore new realms of design. The collection includes the Concrete Club lever handle, a relaxed take on modern silhouettes with fully rounded edges; the Concrete Quad lever handle, featuring straight, squared edges; and the Concrete Niki, a [perfectly round knob](https://www.designerdoorware.com/).
