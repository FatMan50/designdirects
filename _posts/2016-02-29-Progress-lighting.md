A fixture with mechanical nature – and unique authenticity – is what is pleasing about Swing. [The Swing collection](https://www.hubbell.com/progresslighting/en/) includes spheres and pendants that mimic the authentic, industrial style of the family’s original linear and round, warehouse-styled fixture designs with mixed metal accents and vintage undertones.<!--more--> The six-light linear frame with natural brass accents and steel cables, lends itself to a crafted, warehouse form. It can revive the look over kitchen islands and bar areas, while adding to a vintage electric feel. Exposed Edison bulbs provide added visual appeal, while mixed metal accents embrace the popular trend to vary finishes within one space.
