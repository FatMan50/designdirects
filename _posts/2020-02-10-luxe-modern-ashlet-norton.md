Hardware is the only part of a door that users touch multiple times a day, and [Ashley Norton’s Luxe Modern Leversets](https://www.ashleynorton.com/) blend distinctive texture with clean lines to make this experience luxurious. Designed for high-end residential and commercial projects, the ergonomic levers add visual and tactile interest to any space.<!--more-->

Each design in the series features an overall modern look, but the addition of both a knurled and a reeded pattern provide users with a more pleasant and engaging experience—all while speaking to today’s desire for luxury.

The [Luxe Modern collection](https://www.ashleynorton.com/) consists of five distinctively modern options. All three designs—the geometric Knurled Bauhaus lever, the tubular Knurled Fountain lever, and the cap-styled Knurled Phoenix lever—include the unique hashmark-styled knurling detail. The reeded pattern, similar to the ridges found on the side of a dome, adorns the Reeded Bauhaus lever and Reeded Fountain lever.
