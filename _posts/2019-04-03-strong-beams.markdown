[Boise Cascade](https://www.bc.com/apples-to-apples/) is relaunching its premium **Versa-Lam LVL** (*laminated veneer lumber*) as 2.1E Versa-Lam LVL with increased modulus of elasticity (**MOE**) grades. 2.1E Versa-Lam reflects ‘True E’ deflection calculations, a common approach to assigning MOE grades. The shift simplifies the specification process of wood structures. With 2.1E Versa-Lam LVL, specifiers can avoid confusion when evaluating EWP products and reduce the risk of substituting EWP beams with deficient properties on building projects. 2.1E Versa-Lam LVL will begin shipping in early summer **2019**.
