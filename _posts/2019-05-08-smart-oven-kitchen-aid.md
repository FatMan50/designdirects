[KitchenAid](https://www.kitchenaid.com/) enters its centennial year by making its smart home debut with its innovative [KitchenAid® Smart Oven+ with Powered Attachments](https://www.kitchenaid.com/). The oven opens up new culinary possibilities for home cooks to experiment and explore. The Smart Oven+ features three interchangeable, oven-powered attachments that expand the creative horizons of a wall oven to include grilling, baking and steaming within one appliance. The [Smart Oven+](https://www.kitchenaid.com/) can also bake a meal without attachments. The Even-Heat™ True Convection Oven promotes better circulation and air flow, providing consistent heating and cooking. A 4.5-inch, full-color, glass-touch LCD display is compatible with mobile devices and allows users to easily view and select from a variety of capabilities, giving users control of cooking modes.
