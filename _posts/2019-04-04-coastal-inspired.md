With the introduction of Whitecap, [Eldorado Stone](http://eldoradostone.com) reveals the next generation of modern coloring techniques and continues to elevate the tones and textures found in the natural world. Whether applied on an accent wall or as the focal point of any space, Whitecap infuses subtle warmth while providing a balance of strength and beauty that characterizes some of the nation’s most treasured seaside escapes.

As the latest addition to [Eldorado Stone’s Modern Collection](http://eldoradostone.com), Whitecap LedgeCut33 guarantees a natural and authentic appearance. Designed for dry-stack installation, this profile is easy to handle, cut and install. The number 33 represents the 3-inch height and three different lengths of 12 inches, 18 inches and 24 inches of each individual stone shape. In addition to Whitecap, LedgeCut33 is available nationwide in five inspiring color palettes: Beach Pebble, Birch, Golden Oak, Ocean Floor and Sage.
