Available in eight-inch Signature Grade planks, each carefully hand selected by [Carlisle craftsmen](https://www.wideplankflooring.com/), the Tranquil Collection includes six inspiring colors: Eden, Haven, Harbor, Oasis, Preserve and Sanctuary. Ranging from a subtly weathered taupe to a deep warm gray to a richly saturated brown, the collectionâ€™s inviting hues encourage homeowners to transition from the chaos of their daily lives into a feeling of comfort and calm. The organic character of the timber is artfully maintained, instilling a sense of elegance and an instinctual connection with nature.
