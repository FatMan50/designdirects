[Feeney, Inc.](https://www.feeneyinc.com/) introduces [DesignRail® Panel Infill](https://www.feeneyinc.com/), a trend forward line of alternative infills for both interior and exterior railing applications. The new infills will be offered in a variety of standard materials and styles, and can also be customized to meet almost any residential or commercial design specification. <!--more-->Styles include stainless steel wire mesh and laser cut aluminum panels with powder-coated finishes for interior or exterior applications. Feeney will also offer resin panels with embedded materials such as rice grass and leaves for use in interior settings. Available for 36- and 42-inch railing heights, the infills can be mixed-and-matched with [Feeney’s other DesignRail® infill options](https://www.feeneyinc.com/) – including CableRail, glass, vertical cable and pickets – and are compatible with all DesignRail® top rail styles and with [Feeney Post Accent Lights](https://www.feeneyinc.com/). The laser cut aluminum panel infills can be powder-coated in any DesignRail® or custom color, providing even more design flexibility.
