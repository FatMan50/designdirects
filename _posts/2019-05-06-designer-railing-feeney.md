[Feeney, Inc.](https://www.feeneyinc.com/) introduces [DesignRail® Panel Infill](https://www.feeneyinc.com/), a trend forward line of alternative infills for both interior and exterior railing applications. The new infills will be offered in a variety of standard materials and styles, and can also be customized to meet almost any residential or commercial design specification. Styles include stainless steel wire mesh and laser cut aluminum panels with powder-coated finishes for interior or exterior applications. Feeney will also offer resin panels with embedded materials such as rice grass and leaves for use in interior settings. Available for 36- and 42-inch railing heights, the infills can be mixed-and-matched with [Feeney’s other DesignRail® infill options](https://www.feeneyinc.com/) – including CableRail, glass, vertical cable and pickets – and are compatible with all DesignRail® top rail styles and with [Feeney Post Accent Lights](https://www.feeneyinc.com/). The laser cut aluminum panel infills can be powder-coated in any DesignRail® or custom color, providing even more design flexibility.
