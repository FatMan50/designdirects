A mashup of [Victorian aesthetic and “cyberpunk](http://www.calfaucets.com),” the steampunk genre has its own subculture encompassing fashion, music, literature, movies, and gaming. Extending this retro-futuristic look to faucetry, the [Steampunk Bay® Series from California Faucet](http://www.calfaucets.coms) blends functional utilitarian shapes and slightly distressed finishes with solid brass construction and today’s best water-saving sink technology. <!--more-->This powerful yet elegant series takes its cues from industrial-age precision markings, wheel assist handles, and surface textures. 

The versatile collection includes a single hole version (*which can also be used as a bar faucet*) as well as widespread or wall-mounted versions.  In addition, the series offers two spout options: curved high-arc spout or a slightly square low-spout design. A choice of three handle styles includes a Wheel design reminiscent of antique gears used to turn cog wheels, a trapezoidal, wing-like Widespread handle design, and Blade handle, with a triangular shape, reminiscent of an airplane rudder.
