The latest innovation from [Amba Products](https://ambaproducts.com/), the Radiant Small, keeps laundry items dry and free of mildew, saves time and energy, and reduces laundry loads. Running a typical electric clothes dryer uses the same energy as a refrigerator, clothes washer and dishwasher combined, while heated<!--more--> towel racks use the same amount of electricity as a few standard light bulbs. Spending less time and money on laundry is a win for families. Atlanta-based [Amba Products makes more than 150 affordable heated towel rack models](https://ambaproducts.com/) in a variety of mounted and free-standing profiles.
