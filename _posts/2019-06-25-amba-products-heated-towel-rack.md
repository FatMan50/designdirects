[Amba Products](https://ambaproducts.com/) was established in **2004** with a clear goal in mind – to make the heated towel rack a must-have item for every bathroom in North America. <!--more-->While Europeans have been drying and warming their towels on heated towel racks for decades, most Americans have no experience with them. For many Americans, heated towel racks are view as overpriced, not widely available and seen only in the homes of the rich. A perception has persisted that they are a luxury item out of reach for most American families. Amba Products changed this view and are proud to be one of the first companies in the **U.S.** to introduce consumers to affordable, stylish heated towel racks made of high-quality stainless steel. [Amba Products come in 150 models](https://ambaproducts.com/), are energy-efficient, and help to reduce mildew while increasing comfort.
