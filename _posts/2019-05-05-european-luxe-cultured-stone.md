[Cultured Stone](https://www.culturedstone.com/) continues to innovate and drive industry trends with the release of Textured Cast-Fit, a large-format manufactured stone veneer full of visual and tactile appeal. Its weathered surface includes intricate peaks and valleys that add to the dramatic presentation of variegated edge-to-edge color tones. The [Euro-inspired Cast-Fit](https://www.culturedstone.com/) profile now includes Carbon, a new option that emulates the subtle shifts of light and dark tones present in morning fog just before daybreak.
