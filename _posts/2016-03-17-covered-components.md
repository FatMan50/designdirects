We’ve been trying to hide unsightly electrical outlets since electricity first entered homes. [Covered Components has introduced its Hidden Outlets](https://coveredcomponents.com/) that “hide electrical outlets in plain sight”. Beautiful kitchen backsplashes remain beautiful; and no need to position furniture throughout the house to cover the old necessary eyesores.<!--more--> [Covered Components](https://coveredcomponents.com/)’ receptacles are recessed in their own electrical box, allowing the cover to reside flush against the wall blending into the surrounding wall surface when painted to match. A touch of your finger opens the cover that rotates into the box completely out of the way. Your outlets can now be as accessible as ever, but for the first time, they blend-in beautifully with your homes’ décor.
