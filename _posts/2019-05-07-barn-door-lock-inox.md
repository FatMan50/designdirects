[INOX®](http://www.unisonhardware.com/) introduces the industry’s first surface-mounted lock made specifically for barn doors. The [Surface Mount Barn Door Lock](http://www.unisonhardware.com/) is a patented, easy-to-install stainless steel lock designed to reduce installation time while still providing durable safety and security.<!--more-->

The locking mechanism features a one-inch bolt that is activated by a one-touch thumb lever, including an ADA option and can be locked from inside the room. A dust-proof strike is installed on the barn door to eliminate dust and debris from collecting, ensuring longevity of performance. Five designer finishes provide both aesthetic and practical options that complement any design space, including: Bright Stainless Steel, Satin Stainless Steel, Satin Brass, Oil Rubbed Bronze and Graphite Black.
