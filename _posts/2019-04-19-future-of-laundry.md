[Laundry Jet](https://www.laundryjet.com "the future of laundry") has raised the bar yet again in laundry handling in the home. The award-winning Laundry Jet already allows you to send all your dirty laundry from up to 8 separate rooms in your home to your laundry room. However, a follow up launch to the first ever “*Powered*” Laundry Chute has added 2 significant upgrades. The new **LRU** (*Laundry Return Unit*) is an optional add-on to your [Laundry Jet system](https://www.laundryjet.com "the future of laundry") enabling return of clean and dried clothes back to a chosen bedroom or closet for ironing, folding, etc. This is perfect for multi-story homes and especially useful for folks with mobility challenges. The [new Laundry Jet Wave](https://www.laundryjet.com "the future of laundry") port has been simultaneously launched, adding an inbuilt motion sensor “*eye*” allowing the system to be started with a gentle wave of your hand. This is invaluable if you are carrying an armful of bed linen or dirty clothes.
