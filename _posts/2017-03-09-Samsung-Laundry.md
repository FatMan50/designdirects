[FlexWash FlexDry](https://www.samsung.com/us/explore/flex-wash/) laundry system is a versatile laundry pair designed to offer two washers and two dryers in one system, giving consumers more choices to do laundry the way they want, in all types of situations. <!--more-->

Each machine has two distinct compartments: The FlexWash front-loader offers 5 cubic feet of capacity to handle normal or bulky loads, and a top-loader to wash smaller loads separately. Users may operate both washers at the same time with different settings.

To dry fabrics, FlexDry can tackle large laundry loads with the added flexibility to dry a few delicate items at the same time. Users can lay clothes flat in the unique Delicate Rack zone at the top of the dryer and gently dry with a controlled, heated air flow.

Incorporating a range of core [Samsung laundry technologies,](https://www.samsung.com/us/) FlexWash + FlexDry provides the most advanced, flexible laundry solution to meet the needs of busy modern families.
