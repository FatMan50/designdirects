[SpaceMaker is THE ANSWER](https://admiral-spacemaker.com/) for all elevated decking projects.   SpaceMaker is a gorgeous, high-quality tongue & groove decking product with a patented SUPER-SEAL between the boards to keep the space under the deck dry.   Only the best materials, no wood dust waste in the core, nothing to mold or mildew, <!--more--> with a cap coat that provides the best possible fade and stain resistance.  EASY INSTALLATION.  Use regular decking screws that are hidden screws without any extra hardware costs.  AND the underside of the board is engineered with a bright, pebble-grained ceiling surface.   Install ceiling fans, lights & speakers without any water worries.
