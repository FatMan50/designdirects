Modern Flames is proud to introduce the [FusionFire™ Steam Fireplace,](https://www.modernflames.com/) the next step in the company’s revolutionary line of innovative fireplace products. This is the first product in the hearth industry to successfully bridge the gap between gas and electric fireplaces by combining the natural, three-dimensional flame appearance of a gas fireplace with the safety and ease of installation of an electric fireplace. <!--more--> This product was designed to handle the rigors of everyday use and consumes extremely small amounts of water while only requiring a standard 120V household circuit. Because it is safe to the touch and uses clean steam energy, no clearances or restrictions are required for installation. With these specifications, this product can be installed virtually anywhere inside the home and provides an economically low “in place” cost to the builder or consumer.
