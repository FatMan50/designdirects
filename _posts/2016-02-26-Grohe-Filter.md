[GROHE Blue® Chilled & Sparkling](www.grohe.com/us) combines the modern look of a designer faucet with a high-performance filter, cooler and carbonator – and is as easy to use as an ordinary kitchen faucet. The right lever on the faucet is used to mix hot and cold tap water as usual.<!--more--> A single turn of the left handle gives you fresh, cooled and two settings for sparkling water. Finished in [GROHE StarLight®](www.grohe.com/us) chrome or SuperSteel Infinity FinishTM, the faucet has separate internal waterways – one for filtered water and the other for unfiltered water.
