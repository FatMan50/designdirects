[LumaStream, makers of innovative, premium low-voltage LED lighting systems](https://www.lumastream.com/) has introduced the **IDL6R Downlight Fixture**, an elegant low-profile 6-inch solution available in round or square form factors. The **IDL6R** delivers pleasing light from an astonishingly wide **140-degree beam angle**, making it an ideal solution for nearly any application. <!--more-->The [LumaStream IDL6R reduces glare by using LEDs pointing toward the rear of the lens-less fixture](https://www.lumastream.com/), reflecting a visually comfortable indirect light into the desired space. The fully-dimmable **IDL6R** is a low-profile IC-rated (*Insulation Contact*) fixture that eliminates the cumbersome metal frame that is associated with most recessed lighting. Lighting installers no longer have to be concerned with the presence of insulation and/or humidity around their recessed lighting installations because there are no electronics located within the fixture assembly. [LumaStream](https://www.lumastream.com/) offers a full end-to-end, architectural LED lighting solution that is modern and energy-efficient.
