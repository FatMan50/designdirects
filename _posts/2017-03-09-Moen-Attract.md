From falling out of place to clunky cradles that clash with your décor, the design of some handshowers can prove to be a challenge -- but it's time to stop struggling. [Moen's innovative Magnetix™](https://www.moen.com/) technology has transformed the experience of using handshowers, making it easier than ever. <!--more--> The Attract™ handshower features Moen’s innovative Magnetix™ technology, a powerful magnetic dock that allows for easy release of the handshower, as well as a secure return back into place – even when your eyes are closed.  
 
The Attract handshower offers six high-performance spray options, ranging from massage to combinations of soft and forceful full-rinse sprays. A larger spray face provides exceptional coverage, while the magnetic dock ensures the handshower always faces forward, meaning water goes where the user wants it. Attract is available with a dial or a pushbutton to change between settings. [Visit moen.com](https://www.moen.com/) for more details.
