Each book follows a stylistic theme, showcasing modern floor plans in an array of square footages and styles. Featuring full-color photography and renderings, these beautiful, high-value books are a “must have” resource and catalog for anyone - consumer or builder - who is looking to build a new home. Direct from the designers to you, this series focuses on the latest and greatest in home design.
